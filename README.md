# YOUTUBE MIX REMOVER

A lightweight Manifest V3 Chrome extension that prevents youtube from redirecting you to autogenerated "Youtube Mix" playlists when clicking music videos.  Instead of loading a mix the extension will navigate you directly to the video.

## FUNCTIONALITY
The script checks wether the URL matches a Youtube Mix pattern using regular expressions.  (Checks if the URL contains "&list=RD" or "&start_radio=1"
If a match is detected the navigation is prevented and the video ID is extracted from the URL to reconstruct a cleaned URL without Mix parameters.
The browser is redirected using window.location.assign()

Due to the listener running in the capture phase, it executes before YouTubes own JavaScript can process your click, ensuring a Mix playlist does not start.

  - Open chrome and navigate to "chrome://extensions"
  - Enable Developer Mode in the top right corner
